# RuneSong

RuneSong is a Unity RPG made over a span of seven months with a team of five people including myself. I mainly worked on the gameplay mechanics, notably the Active Time Battle style of combat seen in games like Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII. 

There were a few Unity Asset Store assets that were used in the making of this game The list below will be continually updated as files and other game materials are accounted for over time. The assets listed also include assets used in the past that are no longer being used.
