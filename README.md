# RuneSong

RuneSong is a Unity RPG I worked on over a span of seven months throughout three level design classes with a team of five people including myself. I mainly worked on the gameplay mechanics, notably the Active Time Battle style of combat seen in games like Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII, but also worked on implementing other assets in the engine including the environments.
